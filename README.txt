=====


PyPPI (Python Private Package Index) is a Django application that provides a private
`Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
Originally forked from the `DjangoPyPi`_ project, this project gets ideas and code from
`chishop`_ and `DjangoPyPi2`_.

The reason of this project is that in big environment we need features not provided by the orginal packages:

* Ability to allow/deny package registration
* Ability to allow/deny package distribution upload
* Different levels of visibility and access to the packages
* Create Teams with proper access level
* webhooks
* improved rest interface
